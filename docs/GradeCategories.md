## Grade Categories

We need to calculate Internal for:

1. Attendacne
1. Assignments
1. Mid Semester Examinations (MSE)

So accordingly, we will create these three categories for grades.

Watch video at [https://youtu.be/rf2Nx6PWnWY](https://youtu.be/rf2Nx6PWnWY).

To do this, follow steps given below:

1.  From your course home, click on setup icon (Gear/Cog),and from drop-down
click on `Gradebook setup`, or locate it under ``Course Administration" from
"Administration" block, normally on right side of screen.
1. You will be at ``Gradeboo setup" under ``Setup" tab. At the bottom of page,
locate ``Add category", and click on it.
1. On new page presented, fill name of category. We will take example
category of ``Attendance". So type Attendance in edot box, next to ``Category
Name".
1. Next, for ``Aggregation", select ``Weighted mean of grades" from drop-down.
1. Next, confirm whether ``Exclude empty grades" suits your strategy.  If
you keep it ticked (by default), then only non-empty grades are aggregated,
and emplty grades are ignored.  If you untick it, then their empty grades
will count as a 0 and will be counted in the course mean/total.
1. For ``Drop the lowest" use 0 (zero), as here we like to consider all items
in the category ``Attendacne". For some other category, like ``Assignments",
you may like to consider best 10 out of 12, then set this value as 2.
1. Expand ``Category total", make sure ``Grade type" is set to ``Value".
1. Set ``Maximum grade" as 6, as we give maximum 6 marks to attendacne.
1. Only important setting are discussed. It is advisable to explore other
setting as well.
1. At the bottom click on button ``Save changes".
