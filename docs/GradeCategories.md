## Grade Categories

We need to calculate Internal for:

1. Attendacne
1. Assignments
1. Mid Semester Examinations (MSE)

So accordingly, we will create these three categories for grades.

To do this, follow steps given below:

1.  From your course home, click on setup icon (Gear/Cog),and from drop-down
click on `Gradebook setup`, or locate it under "Course Administration" from
"Administration" block, normally on right side of screen.
1. You will be at "Gradeboo setup" under "Setup" tab. At the bottom of page,
locate "Add category", and click on it.
1. On new page presented, fill name of category. We will take example
category of "Attendance". So type Attendance in edot box, next to "Category
Name".
1. Next, for "Aggregation", select "Weighted mean of grades" from drop-down.
