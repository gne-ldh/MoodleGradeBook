## Internal Award Calculation

We will explain the procedure to calculate Internal Assesment Awards, using
Moodle's GradeBook.

Moodle's GradeBook is a powerful tool for managing grades, sharing grades
and feedback with students and calculating final grades.  Student will get
marks on the basis of various activities like Attendacne, Assignments, Mid
Semester Examinations (MSE).

We can create all these activities without setting up a gradebook.  However
it is better, if we set up grade book inadvance.

However we will follow first approach, as that will cover most common
apprach adopted by a beginner.

Let us take we have a class with sections A, B and B furhther have two
sub-sections B1 and B2.

We conducted two lectures per week for whole class (combined section A and
B). Two lectures per week conducted for each section separately. Then
tutorial, one per week at sub-section level. Secion A no sub-section (as
strength of student is less). Section B has two sub-groups, B1 and B2. So
tutorials are conducted for section A, B1 and B2 separately.

For assignments, let take six assignments are given to students, each of 10
marks, and we will consider best four. We also conducted 5 Quizzes, and out
of 5 bes4 four will be consider of grades towards "Assignments".  

We conducted two MSEs and one makeup / improvement MSE. So out of three best
two will be considered. Each MSE is of 24 marks

We have created all these activities, without assigning then any category,
amd we are at the end of semester. Now we will classify all these
activities, and calculate internal assessment.

We assume that you can upload marks for any activity, if marks / grades are
not automatically calculated by Moodle system. 

If you don't know how to upload marks from spreadsheet, then watch movie:
